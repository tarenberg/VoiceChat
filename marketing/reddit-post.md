# r/AndroidApps Post — Beta Tester Recruitment

**Title:** I'm a fine artist who spent the last year building an AI voice conversation app. Muffin Voice is free — looking for beta testers and honest feedback!

Hey everyone 👋

I'm Tom — I've been a fine artist for 30 years (painted for Mariah Carey, John Mellencamp, had my work on Times Square billboards back in 2005). Somewhere along the way I fell down the AI rabbit hole and ended up building an app.

**Muffin Voice** is a voice conversation app powered by Google Gemini with full-duplex audio — meaning you talk and it talks back naturally, no tap-to-speak, no awkward pauses. Think of it like having a conversation with someone who actually listens.

**What makes it different:**

- 🎭 **8 distinct personas** — each with their own personality and conversation style
- 🔊 **Ambient sounds** — coffee shop, rain, fireplace, etc. Makes it feel less like talking to a computer
- 📷 **Camera support** — point your camera at something and talk about it
- 🧠 **Memory** — it remembers context from previous conversations
- 🎙️ **Full-duplex audio** — real back-and-forth, not walkie-talkie style

It's **completely free**, no ads, no paywalls. I built this because I wanted it to exist, and now I want to make it actually good — which is where you come in.

I'm a solo indie dev (well, artist-turned-dev), so every piece of feedback genuinely matters. I read everything.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/tarenberg/VoiceChat

I'd love to hear what works, what doesn't, what feels weird, what you wish it did. Don't hold back.

Thanks for reading 🙏
