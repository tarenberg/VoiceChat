AI voice conversations that feel like talking to a friend

## Description

Muffin Voice is a full-duplex AI voice conversation app built on Google Gemini. No tap-to-speak buttons, no robotic pauses — just natural, flowing dialogue.

Choose from 8 unique personas, set the mood with ambient sounds (rain, coffee shop, fireplace), point your camera at anything to talk about it, and let the app remember your conversations over time.

Built by Thomas Arenberg — a fine artist with a 30-year career who painted for Mariah Carey, had work on Times Square billboards, and decided to channel that creative energy into building the voice app he wished existed.

Free. No ads. Open source.

## Maker Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Tom. For 30 years I've been a fine artist — oil paintings, murals, commercial work (Mariah Carey, John Mellencamp, Times Square billboards in 2005). A couple years ago I started exploring AI tools and fell in love with the creative possibilities.

I wanted a voice AI that felt like a real conversation — not a command-and-response assistant. Something where I could just *talk*. Think out loud. Brainstorm. Have the AI push back, ask questions, riff with me.

That's Muffin Voice. Full-duplex audio means we're both talking in real time. The personas give it character. The ambient sounds make it feel like you're somewhere, not just staring at a screen.

It's free and open source because I built it for the love of making things. Would love your feedback — I'm here all day answering questions.

## First Comment Strategy

Post the maker comment above immediately after launch. Then engage with every single comment within the first hour. Key talking points to weave in:

1. **The artist angle** — People will be curious. Lean into the story.
2. **Why full-duplex matters** — Most voice AIs are half-duplex. Explain the difference with a relatable analogy ("It's like the difference between a walkie-talkie and a phone call").
3. **Persona details** — When asked, describe 2-3 personas with personality.
4. **Open source** — Link to GitHub. Developers love transparency.
5. **What's next** — Share the roadmap. People want to invest in a product with a future.

Respond to negative feedback gracefully — "That's exactly the kind of feedback I need. Solo dev here, so every bug report gets my full attention."
