10 posts for Instagram / TikTok / Twitter. Mix of app demos, behind-the-scenes, story, features, and tips.

## Post 1 — Launch Announcement
**Platform:** Twitter / Instagram / TikTok

**Caption:**
I spent 30 years as a fine artist. Painted for Mariah Carey. Had my work on Times Square billboards. Now I built an AI voice app.

Muffin Voice — real conversations with AI. Full-duplex audio, 8 personas, ambient sounds. Free.

This is the weirdest career pivot and I'm here for it 🎨→📱

**Visual:** Split screen — left side: Tom painting in his studio / old photos of artwork. Right side: phone screen showing Muffin Voice in conversation. Slow pan transition between the two worlds.

## Post 2 — Full-Duplex Demo
**Platform:** TikTok / Instagram Reels

**Caption:**
Most AI voice apps work like a walkie-talkie. Muffin Voice works like an actual conversation.

Watch me interrupt it mid-sentence. It just… adapts. 🤯

**Visual:** Screen recording of a live conversation. Tom interrupts the AI, talks over it, and the AI naturally adjusts. Side-by-side comparison: "walkie-talkie mode" (awkward pauses) vs "full-duplex" (natural flow). Keep it under 30 seconds.

## Post 3 — Ambient Sounds Feature
**Platform:** Instagram / TikTok

**Caption:**
Rain sounds + AI conversation = the most relaxing brainstorm session you've ever had ☔🧠

Muffin Voice has ambient soundscapes that change how you think. Coffee shop energy. Fireplace calm. Try it.

**Visual:** Close-up of phone with Muffin Voice open. Slowly pull back to reveal a cozy setting. Layer in the ambient rain sound. Show the conversation flowing. ASMR vibes. Warm lighting.

## Post 4 — Behind the Scenes: Learning to Code
**Platform:** TikTok / Instagram Reels

**Caption:**
POV: You're a 50-something painter learning to code for the first time

Day 1: "What's a function?"
Day 100: *ships an app to the Play Store*

The AI helped me build the AI. The irony is not lost on me 😂

**Visual:** Time-lapse style montage. Frustrated face at laptop. Stack of art books next to coding docs. Terminal with errors. Then — the app running on a phone. Triumph. Use trending audio if applicable.

## Post 5 — Persona Showcase
**Platform:** Instagram Carousel / Twitter Thread

**Caption:**
8 personas. 8 completely different conversations.

The one you pick at 7 AM for journaling is NOT the one you want at midnight for creative brainstorming.

Swipe to meet them →

**Visual:** Carousel with one card per persona (or highlight 4-5). Each card has a distinct color/mood, persona name, a one-line personality description, and a sample conversation snippet. Clean design, bold typography.

## Post 6 — Camera Feature Demo
**Platform:** TikTok / Instagram Reels

**Caption:**
Pointed my camera at one of my paintings and asked the AI what it saw.

Its answer genuinely surprised me. 🎨👁️

**Visual:** Tom holds phone up to a painting. The AI responds via voice (subtitled) with an insightful observation about composition or color. Tom reacts genuinely. Raw, unscripted feel.

## Post 7 — The Times Square Story
**Platform:** Instagram / Twitter

**Caption:**
In 2005 I had six paintings on billboards in Times Square. I stood on Broadway and watched tourists walk past my art.

20 years later I built an app in my living room.

The scale is different. The feeling is exactly the same.

Muffin Voice is live. Link in bio.

**Visual:** Old photo of the Times Square billboards (if available) alongside a current photo of Tom with the app on his phone. Nostalgic, warm tone. Slight grain filter on the old photo.

## Post 8 — Memory Feature
**Platform:** Twitter / Instagram

**Caption:**
Told the AI about a project I'm working on last week.

Opened the app today and it asked me how it was going.

That's the thing about memory — it turns a tool into a relationship. 🧠

Muffin Voice remembers.

**Visual:** Two screenshots side by side. Conversation from "last week" where the user mentions a project. Today's conversation where the AI references it naturally. Clean phone mockup with a subtle timeline arrow between them.

## Post 9 — Why It's Free + Open Source
**Platform:** Twitter / Instagram

**Caption:**
Muffin Voice is free. No ads. No paywall. Open source.

Why? Because I didn't build this to make money. I built it because I wanted it to exist.

Same reason I paint. 🖼️

GitHub: github.com/tarenberg/VoiceChat

**Visual:** Simple text-on-screen design with the quote "I built it because I wanted it to exist" in large type. Muffin Voice logo. GitHub link. Minimal, clean aesthetic.

## Post 10 — Call for Feedback
**Platform:** All platforms

**Caption:**
I'm a solo dev. One person. Every review, every DM, every bug report — I read it all.

If you try Muffin Voice, tell me what's broken. Tell me what's missing. Tell me what surprised you.

This is how indie apps get better. 🙏

**Visual:** Casual selfie-style video. Tom talking directly to camera, genuine and unpolished. "Hey, I built this thing, I'd love your help making it better." 15-20 seconds. End with the app icon and download prompt.
