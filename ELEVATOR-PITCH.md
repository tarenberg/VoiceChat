## ⚡ 30-Second Pitch

> Muffin Voice is an AI voice companion app that lets you have real, natural conversations with AI — not type at a chatbot. It comes with 8 unique personas like an Art Mentor, Language Tutor, and Interview Coach, plus you can create your own. It remembers your conversations, supports camera and screen sharing, and has ambient soundscapes to set the mood. Free to try, $4.99/month for unlimited. It's available on Android and web, built by a fine artist, and it's the most beautiful AI app you'll ever talk to.

## 🎤 60-Second Pitch

> I spent 30 years as a fine artist — my paintings were on Times Square billboards, I worked with Mariah Carey and John Mellencamp. But when I discovered AI voice technology, I realized something was missing. Every AI assistant feels robotic. Every chatbot feels like typing into a void. So I built Muffin Voice.
>
> It's a voice-first AI companion powered by Google's Gemini. You talk naturally — full-duplex, no waiting for beeps. Choose from 8 personas: an Art Mentor that critiques your work through your camera, a Language Tutor for conversation practice, an Interview Coach, a Wellness Guide with ambient rain and ocean sounds. Or create your own persona.
>
> What makes it different? It was designed by an artist, not an engineer. The animated orb UI is mesmerizing. It remembers you across sessions. And it costs $4.99 a month — not $20 like ChatGPT.
>
> We're live on Android with web coming, and the code is open source on GitHub. I'm looking for early users, press coverage, and anyone who believes AI should feel as good as it sounds.

## 📧 Email Pitch Template

**Subject:** A fine artist built an AI voice app — and it's beautiful

Hi [Name],

I'm Thomas Arenberg, a fine artist from New Haven, CT. For 30 years, my work appeared in galleries, on Times Square billboards, and in campaigns for clients like Mariah Carey and John Mellencamp.

Now I've built my first app: **Muffin Voice** — an AI voice companion that lets you have real conversations with 8 unique AI personas.

**What makes it different:**
- 🗣️ Full-duplex voice (not text-to-speech — actual natural conversation)
- 🎭 8 personas: Art Mentor, Language Tutor, Interview Coach, Wellness Guide & more
- 📷 Camera support for real-time visual feedback (show it your art, your code, your outfit)
- 🌊 Ambient soundscapes (rain, ocean, fireplace)
- 💾 Cross-session memory — it actually remembers you
- 🎨 Designed by an artist — the UI is a beautiful animated orb with waveform particles

**Free tier:** 5 minutes/day | **Premium:** $4.99/month unlimited
**Platform:** Android (Google Play) + Web
**Open source:** github.com/tarenberg/VoiceChat

I think this would resonate with your audience because [personalize: "your readers love indie apps" / "you cover the intersection of art and tech" / "language learning tools are your beat"].

Happy to share a demo, screenshots, or jump on a quick call.

Best,
Tom Arenberg
