# 🧁 Muffin Voice — Your AI Voice Companion

**Talk naturally with AI. No typing. No waiting. Just speak.**

Muffin Voice is a full-duplex voice conversation app powered by Google Gemini's live audio API. It feels like a real phone call — you talk, your AI companion talks back, and you can even interrupt naturally. No buttons to hold, no awkward pauses.

## ✨ Why Muffin Voice?

Unlike traditional voice assistants that convert speech to text and back, Muffin Voice uses Gemini's **native audio processing**. This means lower latency, better understanding of your tone, and more natural-sounding responses. It's the difference between texting and actually talking.
