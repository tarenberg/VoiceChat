    <h1>🧁 Muffin Voice — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

    <p>Muffin Voice is built by Thomas Arenberg. This policy explains what data the app handles, how it's used, and your rights. We believe in keeping things simple and transparent.</p>

    <h2>What Data Does the App Use?</h2>
    <p><strong>Voice audio:</strong> When you have a conversation, your microphone audio is streamed in real-time to Google's Gemini API for processing. The audio is used solely to generate your AI companion's responses. We (the developer) never receive, store, or have access to your audio.</p>
    <p><strong>Camera and screen data:</strong> If you choose to share your camera or screen, those images are sent to Google's Gemini API during the active session for visual understanding. This is entirely optional and only happens when you explicitly enable it.</p>
    <p><strong>Conversation history:</strong> Summaries and transcripts of your conversations are stored locally on your device using IndexedDB. This data never leaves your device.</p>
    <p><strong>Memory and preferences:</strong> The app remembers facts about you (like your name) to personalize conversations. This information is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB and localStorage. It is not transmitted anywhere.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage data:</strong> The app tracks how many minutes you've used for the daily limit. This is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Muffin Voice uses <strong>Google's Gemini API</strong> to process voice audio and generate responses. When you have a conversation, your audio is sent to Google's servers. Google's use of this data is governed by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">Google's API Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>No other third-party services receive your data.</p>

    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data to anyone. Ever.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect analytics or tracking data.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store your conversations on any server.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> have access to your audio, camera, or screen data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Storage Only</h2>
    <p>All app data — conversation history, memory, preferences, and usage tracking — is stored locally on your device using standard web storage technologies (IndexedDB and localStorage). You can clear this data at any time through the app's settings or by clearing your browser/app data.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Required for voice conversations. You grant permission through your device's standard permission dialog.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Optional. Only activated when you tap the camera button.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen sharing:</strong> Optional. Only activated when you explicitly choose to share.</li>
        <li>You can revoke any permission at any time through your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Muffin Voice is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this policy, we'll post the new version here with an updated date. Continued use of the app means you accept the updated policy.</p>
